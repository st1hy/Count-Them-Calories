     * Launch an activity for which you would like a result when it finished.

     * {@link Activity#startActivity} (the activity is not launched as a sub-activity),
     * and hence will result in a {@link IllegalArgumentException}.

     * that are defined to return a result.  In other protocols (such as
     * {@link Intent#ACTION_MAIN} or {@link Intent#ACTION_VIEW}), you may
     * not get the result when you expect.  For example, if the activity you
     * are launching uses the singleTask launch mode, it will not run in your
     * task and thus you will never receive a result.
     * <p>
     * <p>This method throws {@link IllegalArgumentException}
     * if there was no Activity found to run the given Intent.
     *
     * @param intent      The intent to start.
     * @param requestCode If >= 0, this code will be returned in
     *                    onActivityResult() when the activity exits.
     * @param options     Additional options for how the Activity should be started.
     *                    See {@link android.content.Context#startActivity(Intent, Bundle)
     *                    Context.startActivity(Intent, Bundle)} for more details.
